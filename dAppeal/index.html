                    <blockquote>
                    The most common standard for Ethereum tokens is currently the ERC-20 standard, but there are also ERC-777, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 standards. 
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <h2>ERC-20 Overview</h2>
                    <p>The ERC-20 Token Standard is the standard interface for tokens.</p>
                    <p>The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.</p>
                    
                    <h2>ERC-20 Motivation</h2>
                    <p>A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.</p>
                    
                    <h2>ERC-20 Token Specification</h2>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <h4>name</h4>
                    <dd>Returns the name of the token</dd>
                    <code>function name() public view returns (string)</code>
                    
                    <h4>symbol</h4>
                    <dd>Returns the symbol of the token</dd>
                    <code>function symbol() public view returns (string)</code>
                    
                    <h4>decimal</h4>
                    <dd>Returns the number of decimals the token uses</dd>
                    <code>function decimals() public view returns (uint8)</code>
                    
                    <h4>totalSupply</h4>
                    <dd>Returns the total token supply</dd>
                    <code>function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)</code>
                    
                    <h4>balanceOf</h4>
                    <dd>Returns the account balance of another account with address _owner</dd>
                    <code>function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)</code>
                    
                    <h4>transfer</h4>
                    <dd>Transfers _value amount of tokens to address _to, and MUST fire the Transfer event. The function SHOULD throw if the message caller’s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.</dd>
                    <code>function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
              </code>
                    
                    <h4>transferFrom</h4>
                    <dd>Transfers _value amount of tokens from address _from to address _to, and MUST fire the Transfer event. The transferFrom method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf. This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies. The function SHOULD throw unless the _from account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.</dd>
                    <code>function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

                    <h4>approve</h4>
                    <dd>Allows _spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the _value amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with _value. NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldn’t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before</dd>

                    <dd>Returns the amount which _spender is still allowed to withdraw from _owner</dd>

                  <h2>ERC-777</h2>
                  <article>
                    <p>This standard defines a new way to interact with a token contract while remaining backward compatible with ERC20.</p>
                    <p>It defines advanced features to interact with tokens. Namely, operators to send tokens on behalf of another address—contract or regular account—and send/receive hooks to offer token holders more control over their tokens.</p>
                   <p>It takes advantage of ERC1820 to find out whether and where to notify contracts and regular addresses when they receive tokens as well as to allow compatibility with already-deployed contracts.</p>
                    <h2>ERC-777 Motivation</h2>
                    <p>The principal intent for this standard is to solve some of the shortcomings of ERC20 while maintaining backward compatibility with ERC20, and avoiding the problems and vulnerabilities of EIP223.</p>
                    <p>More than just sending tokens, ERC777 defines the entire lifecycle of a token, starting with the minting process, followed by the sending process and terminating with the burn process.</p>
                    <p>Having a lifecycle clearly defined is important for consistency and accuracy, especially when value is derived from scarcity. In contrast when looking at some ERC20 tokens, a discrepancy can be observed between the value returned by the ' totalSupply ' and the actual circulating supply, as the standard does not clearly define a process to create and destroy tokens.</p>
                    
                    <p>This standard tries to improve upon the widely used ERC20 token standard. The main advantages of this standard are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1. Uses the same philosophy as Ether in that tokens are sent with ' send(dest, value, data) '.</li>
                      <li>2. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which token they send by registering a ' tokensToSend ' hook. (Rejection is done by ' revert 'ing in the hook function.)
              
              </li>
                      <li>3. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which token they receive by registering a ' tokensReceived ' hook. (Rejection is done by ' revert 'ing in the hook function.)</li>
                      <li>4. The tokensReceived hook allows to send tokens to a contract and notify it in a single transaction, unlike ERC20 which requires a double call (' approve ' / ' transferFrom ') to achieve this.</li>
                      <li>5. The holder can “authorize” and “revoke” operators which can send tokens on their behalf. These operators are intended to be verified contracts such as an exchange, a cheque processor or an automatic charging system.</li>
                      <li>6. Every token transaction contains ' data'  and ' operatorData ' bytes fields to be used freely to pass data from the holder and the operator, respectively.</li>
                      <li>7. It is backward compatible with wallets that do not contain the ' tokensReceived ' hook function by deploying a proxy contract implementing the ' tokensReceived hook'  for the wallet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>ERC-777 Token Specificaition</h2>
                    <h3>View Functions</h3>
                    <p>The ' view ' functions detailed below MUST be implemented.</p>
                    <h4>' name ' function</h4>
                    <dd>Get the name of the token, e.g., "MyToken".</dd>
                    <code>function name() external view returns (string memory)
              </code>
                    <h4>' symbol ' function</h4>
                    <dd>Get the symbol of the token, e.g., "MYT".
              
              </dd>
                    <code>function symbol() external view returns (string memory)
              </code>
                    
              <h4>' totalSupply ' function</h4>
              <dd>Get the total number of minted tokens.
              </dd>
                    <p>NOTE: The total supply MUST be equal to the sum of the balances of all addresses—as returned by the balanceOf function.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: The total supply MUST be equal to the sum of all the minted tokens as defined in all the Minted events minus the sum of all the burned tokens as defined in all the Burned events.</p>
              <code>function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
              </code>      
                  <h4>' balanceOf ' function</h4>
                  <dd>Get the balance of the account with address holder.</dd>
                  <code>function balanceOf(address holder) external view returns (uint256)
              </code>
                    <h4>' granularity ' function</h4>
                    <dd>Get the smallest part of the token that’s not divisible.</dd>
                    <code>function granularity() external view returns (uint256)</code>
                    <p>In other words, the granularity is the smallest amount of tokens (in the internal denomination) which MAY be minted, sent or burned at any time. </p>
                    <p>The following rules MUST be applied regarding the granularity:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The granularity value MUST be set at creation time.</li>
                      <li>The granularity value MUST NOT be changed, ever.</li>
                      <li>The granularity value MUST be greater than or equal to 1.</li>
                      <li>All balances MUST be a multiple of the granularity.</li>
                      <li>Any amount of tokens (in the internal denomination) minted, sent or burned MUST be a multiple of the granularity value.</li>
                      <li>Any operation that would result in a balance that’s not a multiple of the granularity value MUST be considered invalid, and the transaction MUST revert.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>NOTE: Most tokens SHOULD be fully partition-able. I.e., this function SHOULD return 1 unless there is a good reason for not allowing any fraction of the token.</p>
              <p>The decimals of the token MUST always be 18. For a pure ERC777 token the ERC20 decimals function is OPTIONAL, and its existence SHALL NOT be relied upon when interacting with the token contract. (The decimal value of 18 is implied.) For an ERC20 compatible token, the decimals function is REQUIRED and MUST return 18. (In ERC20, the decimals function is OPTIONAL. If the function is not present, the decimals value is not clearly defined and may be assumed to be 0. Hence for compatibility reasons, decimals MUST be implemented for ERC20 compatible tokens.)
              </p>      
               
                    <h3>Operators</h3>
                    
                    <p>An ' operator ' is an address which is allowed to send and burn tokens on behalf of some holder.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Authorized Operator</h4>
                    <p>When an address becomes an operator for a holder, an ' AuthorizedOperator ' event MUST be emitted. The AuthorizedOperator’s operator (topic 1) and holder (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the ' operator '  and the ' holder ' respectively.</p>
                    <h4>Revoked Operator</h4>
                    <p>When a holder revokes an operator, a ' RevokedOperator ' event MUST be emitted. The RevokedOperator’s operator (topic 1) and holder (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the ' operator ' and the ' holder ' respectively.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Default Operator</h4>
                    <p>The token MAY define default operators. A default operator is an implicitly authorized operator for all holders. AuthorizedOperator events MUST NOT be emitted when defining the default operators. The rules below apply to default operators:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The token contract MUST define default operators at creation time.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The default operators MUST be invariants. I.e., the token contract MUST NOT add or remove default operators ever.
              
              </li>
                      <li>AuthorizedOperator events MUST NOT be emitted when defining default operators.
              
              </li>
                      <li>A holder MUST be allowed to revoke a default operator (unless the holder is the default operator in question).
              
              </li>
                      <li>A holder MUST be allowed to re-authorize a previously revoked default operator.
              
              </li>
                      <li>When a default operator is explicitly authorized or revoked for a specific holder, an AuthorizedOperator or RevokedOperator event (respectively) MUST be emitted.
              
              </li>
                    </ul>
              <p>The following rules apply to any operator:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>An address MUST always be an operator for itself. Hence an address MUST NOT ever be revoked as its own operator.</li>
                      <li>If an address is an operator for a holder, isOperatorFor MUST return true.
              
              </li>
                      <li>If an address is not an operator for a holder, isOperatorFor MUST return false.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST emit an AuthorizedOperator event with the correct values when a holder authorizes an address as its operator as defined in the AuthorizedOperator Event.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST emit a RevokedOperator event with the correct values when a holder revokes an address as its operator as defined in the RevokedOperator Event.
              
              </li>

                    <h3>Sending Tokens</h3>
                    When an operator sends an amount of tokens from a holder to a recipient with the associated data and operatorData, the token contract MUST apply the following rules:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Any authorized operator MAY send tokens to any recipient (except to 0x0).
              
              </li>
                      <li>The balance of the holder MUST be decreased by the amount.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The balance of the recipient MUST be increased by the amount.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The balance of the holder MUST be greater or equal to the amount—such that its resulting balance is greater or equal to zero (0) after the send.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST emit a Sent event with the correct values as defined in the Sent Event.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The operator MAY include information in the operatorData.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST call the tokensToSend hook of the holder if the holder registers an ERC777TokensSender implementation via ERC1820.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST call the tokensReceived hook of the recipient if the recipient registers an ERC777TokensRecipient implementation via ERC1820.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The data and operatorData MUST be immutable during the entire send process—hence the same data and operatorData MUST be used to call both hooks and emit the Sent event.
              
              </li>
                    </ul>
               <p>The token contract MAY send tokens from many holders, to many recipients, or both. In this case:
              
              </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The previous send rules MUST apply to all the holders and all the recipients.
              </li>
                      <li>The sum of all the balances incremented MUST be equal to the total sent amount.
              </li>
                      <li>The sum of all the balances decremented MUST be equal to the total sent amount.
              </li>
                      <li>A Sent event MUST be emitted for every holder and recipient pair with the corresponding amount for each pair.
              </li>
                      <li>The sum of all the amounts from the Sent event MUST be equal to the total sent amount.
              </li>

                    <p>The token contract MUST revert when sending in any of the following cases:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The operator address is not an authorized operator for the holder.</li>
                      <li>The resulting holder balance or recipient balance after the send is not a multiple of the granularity defined by the token contract.</li>
                      <li>The recipient is a contract, and it does not implement the ' ERC777TokensRecipient ' interface via ERC1820.</li>
                      <li>The address of the holder or the recipient is 0x0.</li>

                      <li>The tokensReceived hook of the recipient reverts.</li>
                    </ul>

              </li>
                      <li>The sum of all the amounts from the Sent event MUST be equal to the total sent amount.</li>
                      <li>Mechanisms such as applying a fee on a send is considered as a send to multiple recipients: the intended recipient and the fee recipien</li>
                      <li>Movements of tokens MAY be chained. For example, if a contract upon receiving tokens sends them further to another address. In this case, the previous send rules apply to each send, in order.</li>
                      <li>Sending an amount of zero (0) tokens is valid and MUST be treated as a regular send.</li>

                    <h3>Minting Token</h3>
                    <p>Minting tokens is the act of producing new tokens. ERC777 intentionally does not define specific functions to mint tokens. This intent comes from the wish not to limit the use of the ERC777 standard as the minting process is generally specific for every token.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nonetheless, the rules below MUST be respected when minting for a recipient:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tokens MAY be minted for any recipient address (except 0x0).</li>
                      <li>The total supply MUST be increased by the amount of tokens minted.</li>
                      <li>The balance of 0x0 MUST NOT be decreased.</li>
                      <li>The balance of the recipient MUST be increased by the amount of tokens minted.</li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST emit a Minted event with the correct values as defined in the Minted Event.</li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST call the tokensReceived hook of the recipient if the recipient registers an ERC777TokensRecipient implementation via ERC1820.</li>
                      <li>The data and operatorData MUST be immutable during the entire mint process—hence the same data and operatorData MUST be used to call the tokensReceived hook and emit the Minted event.</li>

                    <h4>Burning Tokens</h4>
                    <p>Burning tokens is the act of destroying existing tokens. ERC777 explicitly defines two functions to burn tokens (burn and operatorBurn). These functions facilitate the integration of the burning process in wallets and dapps. However, the token contract MAY prevent some or all holders from burning tokens for any reason. The token contract MAY also define other functions to burn tokens.</p>
                    <p>The rules below MUST be respected when burning the tokens of a holder:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tokens MAY be burned from any holder address (except 0x0).</li>
                      <li>The total supply MUST be decreased by the amount of tokens burned.</li>
                      <li>The balance of 0x0 MUST NOT be increased.</li>
                      <li>The balance of the holder MUST be decreased by amount of tokens burned.</li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST emit a Burned event with the correct values as defined in the Burned Event.</li>
                      <li>The token contract MUST call the tokensToSend hook of the holder if the holder registers an ERC777TokensSender implementation via ERC1820.</li>
                      <li>The operatorData MUST be immutable during the entire burn process—hence the same operatorData MUST be used to call the tokensToSend hook and emit the Burned event.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The token contract MUST revert when burning in any of the following cases:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The operator address is not an authorized operator for the holder.
              
              </li>
                      <li>The resulting holder balance after the burn is not a multiple of the granularity defined by the token contract.
              </li>
                      <li>The balance of holder is inferior to the amount of tokens to burn (i.e., resulting in a negative balance for the holder).</li>
                      <li>The address of the holder is 0x0.</li>
                      <li>The tokensToSend hook of the holder reverts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ERC20 compatibility requirement:</p>
                    <dd>While a Sent event MUST NOT be emitted when burning; if the token contract is ERC20 enabled, a Transfer event with the to parameter set to 0x0 SHOULD be emitted. The ERC20 standard does not define the concept of burning tokens, but this is a commonly accepted practice.</dd>
                    <p>The token contract MAY burn tokens for multiple holders at once. In this case:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The previous burn rules MUST apply to each holders.
              </li>
                      <li>The sum of all the balances decremented MUST be equal to the total burned amount.</li>

A contract MAY register either its address or the address of another contract but said address MUST implement the interface on its behalf.</p>
                    
                    <h4>tokensToSend</h4>

              </code>
                    <p>NOTE: This function MUST NOT be called outside of a burn, send or ERC20 transfer process.</p>
                    
                    <p>The following rules apply when calling the tokensToSend hook:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The tokensToSend hook MUST be called for every send and burn processes.</li>
                      <li>The tokensToSend hook MUST be called before the state is updated—i.e. before the balance is decremented.</li>
                      <li>operator MUST be the address which triggered the send or burn process.</li>
                      <li>from MUST be the address of the holder whose tokens are sent or burned.</li>
                      <li>to MUST be the address of the recipient which receives the tokens for a send.</li>
                      <li>to MUST be 0x0 for a burn.</li>
                      <li>amount MUST be the number of tokens the holder sent or burned.</li>
                      <li>data MUST contain the extra information (if any) provided to the send or the burn process.</li>
                      <li>operatorData MUST contain the extra information provided by the address which triggered the decrease of the balance (if any).</li>
                      <li>The holder MAY block a send or burn process by reverting. (I.e., reject the withdrawal of tokens from its account.)</li>
                      <li>Multiple holders MAY use the same implementation of ERC777TokensSender.</li>
                      <li>An address can register at most one implementation at any given time for all ERC777 tokens. Hence the ERC777TokensSender MUST expect to be called by different token contracts. The msg.sender of the tokensToSend call is expected to be the address of the token contract.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ERC20 compatibility requirement:</p> 
                    <p>This hook takes precedence over ERC20 and MUST be called (if registered) when calling ERC20’s transfer and transferFrom event. When called from a transfer, operator MUST be the same value as the from. When called from a transferFrom, operator MUST be the address which issued the transferFrom call.</p>
                    <h4>Note On Gas Consumption</h4>
                    <p>Dapps and wallets SHOULD first estimate the gas required when sending, minting, or burning tokens—using eth_estimateGas—to avoid running out of gas during the transaction.</p>

                  <h2>ERC-721</h2>
                  <article>
                        <p>A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.</p>
                    <p>The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.</p>
                    <p>We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Physical property — houses, unique artwork</li>
                      <li>Virtual collectables — unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards</li>
                      <li>“Negative value” assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are distinguishable and you must track the ownership of each one separately.</p>
                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. We provide for simple ERC-721 smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 token standard and builds on two years of experience since EIP-20 was created. EIP-20 is insufficient for tracking NFTs because each asset is distinct (non-fungible) whereas each of a quantity of tokens is identical (fungible).</p>
                    <p>There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, the eponymous punks in CryptoPunks, and in-game items using systems like DMarket or EnjinCoin. Future uses include tracking real-world assets, like real-estate (as envisioned by companies like Ubitquity or Propy. It is critical in each of these cases that these items are not “lumped together” as numbers in a ledger, but instead each asset must have its ownership individually and atomically tracked. Regardless of the nature of these assets, the ecosystem will be stronger if we have a standardized interface that allows for cross-functional asset management and sales platforms.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Specification</h3>
                    <h4>"NFT" Word Choice</h4>
                    <p>“NFT” was satisfactory to nearly everyone surveyed and is widely applicable to a broad universe of distinguishable digital assets. We recognize that “deed” is very descriptive for certain applications of this standard (notably, physical property). Alternatives considered: distinguishable asset, title, token, asset, equity, ticket.</p>
                    <h4>NFT Identifiers</h4>
                    <p>Every NFT is identified by a unique uint256 ID inside the ERC-721 smart contract. This identifying number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair (contract address, uint256 tokenId) will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an Ethereum chain. While some ERC-721 smart contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply increment by one for each new NFT, callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the ID as a “black box”. Also note that a NFTs MAY become invalid (be destroyed). Please see the enumerations functions for a supported enumeration interface.</p>
                    <p>The choice of uint256 allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to uint256.</p>
                    <h4>Transfer Mechanism</h4>
                    <p>ERC-721 standardizes a safe transfer function safeTransferFrom (overloaded with and without a bytes parameter) and an unsafe function transferFrom. Transfers may be initiated by:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The owner of an NFT</li>
                      <li>The approved address of an NFT</li>
                      <li>An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, an authorized operator may set the approved address for an NFT. This provides a powerful set of tools for wallet, broker and auction applications to quickly use a large number of NFTs.</p>
                    <p>The transfer and accept functions’ documentation only specify conditions when the transaction MUST throw. Your implementation MAY also throw in other situations. This allows implementations to achieve interesting results:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Disallow transfers if the contract is paused — prior art, CryptoKitties deployed contract, line 611</li>
                      <li>Blacklist certain address from receiving NFTs — prior art, CryptoKitties deployed contract, lines 565, 566</li>
                      <li>Disallow unsafe transfers — transferFrom throws unless _to equals msg.sender or countOf(_to) is non-zero or was non-zero previously (because such cases are safe)</li>
                      <li>Charge a fee to both parties of a transaction — require payment when calling approve with a non-zero _approved if it was previously the zero address, refund payment if calling approve with the zero address if it was previously a non-zero address, require payment when calling any transfer function, require transfer parameter _to to equal msg.sender, require transfer parameter _to to be the approved address for the NFT
              </li>
                      <li>Read only NFT registry — always throw from unsafeTransfer, transferFrom, approve and setApprovalForAll</li>
                    </ul>
              
                    <p>Failed transactions will throw, a best practice identified in ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-827 and OpenZeppelin’s implementation of SafeERC20.sol. ERC-20 defined an allowance feature, this caused a problem when called and then later modified to a different amount, as on OpenZeppelin issue #438. In ERC-721, there is no allowance because every NFT is unique, the quantity is none or one. Therefore we receive the benefits of ERC-20’s original design without problems that have been later discovered.</p>
                    <p>Creating of NFTs (“minting”) and destruction NFTs (“burning”) is not included in the specification. Your contract may implement these by other means. Please see the event documentation for your responsibilities when creating or destroying NFTs.</p>
                    <p>Creating of NFTs (“minting”) and destruction NFTs (“burning”) is not included in the specification. Your contract may implement these by other means. Please see the event documentation for your responsibilities when creating or destroying NFTs.</p>
                    <p>We questioned if the operator parameter on onERC721Received was necessary. In all cases we could imagine, if the operator was important then that operator could transfer the token to themself and then send it – then they would be the from address. This seems contrived because we consider the operator to be a temporary owner of the token (and transferring to themself is redundant). When the operator sends the token, it is the operator acting on their own accord, NOT the operator acting on behalf of the token holder. This is why the operator and the previous token owner are both significant to the token recipient.</p>
                    <p>Alternatives considered: only allow two-step ERC-20 style transaction, require that transfer functions never throw, require all functions to return a boolean indicating the success of the operation.</p>
                    <h4>ERC-165 Interface</h4>
                    <p>We chose Standard Interface Detection (ERC-165) to expose the interfaces that a ERC-721 smart contract supports.</p>
              <p>A future EIP may create a global registry of interfaces for contracts. We strongly support such an EIP and it would allow your ERC-721 implementation to implement ERC721Enumerable, ERC721Metadata, or other interfaces by delegating to a separate contract.</p>
                    <h4>Gas and Complexity</h4>
                    <p>This specification contemplates implementations that manage a few and arbitrarily large numbers of NFTs. If your application is able to grow then avoid using for/while loops in your code (see CryptoKitties bounty issue #4). These indicate your contract may be unable to scale and gas costs will rise over time without bound.</p>
                    <p>We have deployed a contract, XXXXERC721, to Testnet which instantiates and tracks 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 different deeds (2^128). That’s enough to assign every IPV6 address to an Ethereum account owner, or to track ownership of nanobots a few micron in size and in aggregate totalling half the size of Earth. You can query it from the blockchain. And every function takes less gas than querying the ENS.</p>
                    <p>This illustration makes clear: the ERC-721 standard scales.</p>
                    <h4>Privacy</h4>
                    <p>Wallets/brokers/auctioneers identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify which NFTs an owner owns.</p>
                    <p>It may be interesting to consider a use case where NFTs are not enumerable, such as a private registry of property ownership, or a partially-private registry. However, privacy cannot be attained because an attacker can simply (!) call ownerOf for every possible tokenId.</p>
                    <h4>Metadata Choices</h4>
                    <p>We have required name and symbol functions in the metadata extension. Every token EIP and draft we reviewed (ERC-20, ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-777, ERC-827) included these functions.</p>
                    <p>We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to name and symbol if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. We also remind everyone that any smart contract can use the same name and symbol as your contract. How a client may determine which ERC-721 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.</p>
                    <p>A mechanism is provided to associate NFTs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each NFT. The image size recommendation is taken from Instagram, they probably know much about image usability. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered an NFT representing ownership of a house, in this case metadata about the house (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.</p>
                    <p>Metadata is returned as a string value. Currently this is only usable as calling from web3, not from other contracts. This is acceptable because we have not considered a use case where an on-blockchain application would query such information.</p>
                    <p>Alternatives considered: put all metadata for each asset on the blockchain (too expensive), use URL templates to query metadata parts (URL templates do not work with all URL schemes, especially P2P URLs), multiaddr network address (not mature enough.)</p>
                    <h3>Backwards Compatibility</h3>
                    <p>We have adopted balanceOf, totalSupply, name and symbol semantics from the ERC-20 specification. An implementation may also include a function decimals that returns uint8(0) if its goal is to be more compatible with ERC-20 while supporting this standard. However, we find it contrived to require all ERC-721 implementations to support the decimals function.</p>
                    <p>Example NFT implementations as of February 2018:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>CryptoKitties – Compatible with an earlier version of this standard.</li>
                      <li>CryptoPunks – Partially ERC-20 compatible, but not easily generalizable because it includes auction functionality directly in the contract and uses function names that explicitly refer to the assets as “punks”.</li>
                      <li>Auctionhouse Asset Interface – The author needed a generic interface for the Auctionhouse ÐApp (currently ice-boxed). His “Asset” contract is very simple, but is missing ERC-20 compatibility, approve() functionality, and metadata. This effort is referenced in the discussion for EIP-173.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Note: “Limited edition, collectible tokens” like Curio Cards and Rare Pepe are not distinguishable assets. They’re actually a collection of individual fungible tokens, each of which is tracked by its own smart contract with its own total supply (which may be 1 in extreme cases).</p>
                    
                    <p>The onERC721Received function specifically works around old deployed contracts which may inadvertently return 1 (true) in certain circumstances even if they don’t implement a function (see Solidity DelegateCallReturnValue bug). By returning and checking for a magic value, we are able to distinguish actual affirmative responses versus these vacuous trues.</p>

                  <h2>ERC-1155</h2>
                  <p>
                 A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).</p>
                <p>This standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. Existing standards such as ERC-20 require deployment of separate contracts per token type. The ERC-721 standard’s token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. In contrast, the ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.</p>
                  <p>The _id argument contained in each function’s argument set indicates a specific token or token type in a transaction.</p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of blockchain games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of token types, and a new type of token standard is needed to support them. However, ERC-1155 is not specific to games and many other applications can benefit from this flexibility.</p>
                  <p>New functionality is possible with this design such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to “approve” individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract.</p>
                  <h3>Specification</h3>
                  <blockquote>Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard MUST implement all of the functions in the ERC1155 interface. Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard MUST implement the ERC-165 supportsInterface function and MUST return the constant value true if 0xd9b67a26 is passed through the interfaceID argument.</blockquote>

                  <dt>Scenario #1 : The recipient is not a contract.</dt>
                  <ul>
                    <li>onERC1155Received and onERC1155BatchReceived MUST NOT be called on an EOA (Externally Owned Account).</li>

              <dt>Scenario #3 : The receiver does not implement the necessary ERC1155TokenReceiver interface function(s).</dt>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The transfer MUST be reverted with the one caveat: 
                      <p>If the token(s) being sent are part of a hybrid implementation of another standard, that particular standard’s rules on sending to a contract MAY now be followed instead. See “Compatibility with other standards” section.</p>.
              </li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The transfer MUST be reverted.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The balances for the transfer MUST have been updated before the ERC1155TokenReceiver hook is called on a recipient contract.</li>
                    <li>The transfer event MUST have been emitted to reflect the balance changes before the ERC1155TokenReceiver hook is called on the recipient contract.
              </li>
                    <li>One of onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived MUST be called on the recipient contract.
              </li>
                    <li>The onERC1155Received hook SHOULD be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed. See “onERC1155Received rules” for further rules that MUST be followed.

                  <ul>
                    <li>All balance transfers that are referenced in a call to an ERC1155TokenReceiver hook MUST be updated before the ERC1155TokenReceiver hook is called on the recipient contract.
              </li>
                    <li>All transfer events MUST have been emitted to reflect current balance changes before an ERC1155TokenReceiver hook is called on the recipient contract.
              </li>
                    <li>onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived MUST be called on the recipient as many times as necessary such that every balance change for the recipient in the scenario is accounted for. The return magic value for every hook call MUST be checked and acted upon as per “onERC1155Received rules” and “onERC1155BatchReceived rules”.
              </li>
                    <li>The onERC1155BatchReceived hook SHOULD be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed. See “onERC1155BatchReceived rules” for further rules that MUST be followed.</li>

                  <dt>Scenario#8 : You are the creator of a contract that implements the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface and you forward the token(s) onto another address in one or both of onERC1155Received and onERC1155BatchReceived.</dt>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Forwarding should be considered acceptance and then initiating a new safeTransferFrom or safeBatchTransferFrom in a new context.
              The prescribed keccak256 acceptance value magic for the receiver hook being called MUST be returned after forwarding is successful.</li>
                    <li>The _data argument MAY be re-purposed for the new context.</li>
                    <li>If forwarding fails the transaction MAY be reverted.
              If the contract logic wishes to keep the ownership of the token(s) itself in this case it MAY do so.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <dt>Scenario#9 : You are transferring tokens via a non-standard API call i.e. an implementation specific API and NOT safeTransferFrom or safeBatchTransferFrom.</dt>
                  <ul>
                    <li>In this scenario all balance updates and events output rules are the same as if a standard transfer function had been called.
              i.e. an external viewer MUST still be able to query the balance via a standard function and it MUST be identical to the balance as determined by TransferSingle and TransferBatch events alone.</li>
                    <li>If the receiver is a contract the ERC1155TokenReceiver hooks still need to be called on it and the return values respected the same as if a standard transfer function had been called.
              However while the safeTransferFrom or safeBatchTransferFrom functions MUST revert if a receiving contract does not implement the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface, a non-standard function MAY proceed with the transfer.
              See “Implementation specific transfer API rules”.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Rationale</h4>
                  <dt>Metadata Choices</dt>
                   <p>The symbol function (found in the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards) was not included as we do not believe this is a globally useful piece of data to identify a generic virtual item / asset and are also prone to collisions. Short-hand symbols are used in tickers and currency trading, but they aren’t as useful outside of that space.</p>
                  <p>The name function (for human-readable asset names, on-chain) was removed from the standard to allow the Metadata JSON to be the definitive asset name and reduce duplication of data. This also allows localization for names, which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if each language string was stored on-chain, not to mention bloating the standard interface. While this decision may add a small burden on implementers to host a JSON file containing metadata, we believe any serious implementation of ERC-1155 will already utilize JSON Metadata.</p>
                  <dt>Upgrades</dt>
                  <p>The requirement to emit TransferSingle or TransferBatch on balance change implies that a valid implementation of ERC-1155 redeploying to a new contract address MUST emit events from the new contract address to replicate the deprecated contract final state. It is valid to only emit a minimal number of events to reflect only the final balance and omit all the transactions that led to that state. The event emit requirement is to ensure that the current state of the contract can always be traced only through events. To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in ERC-1538. This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.</p>
                  <dt>Design decision: Supporting non-batch</dt>
                  <p>The standard supports safeTransferFrom and onERC1155Received functions because they are significantly cheaper for single token-type transfers, which is arguably a common use case.</p>
              <dt>Design decision: Safe transfers only</dt>
                  <p>The standard only supports safe-style transfers, making it possible for receiver contracts to depend on onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived function to be always called at the end of a transfer.</p>
                  <dt>Guaranteed log trace</dt>
                  <p>As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, many dapps are relying on traditional databases and explorer API services to retrieve and categorize data. The ERC-1155 standard guarantees that event logs emitted by the smart contract will provide enough data to create an accurate record of all current token balances. A database or explorer may listen to events and be able to provide indexed and categorized searches of every ERC-1155 token in the contract.</p>
                  
                  <dt>Approval</dt>
                  <p>The function setApprovalForAll allows an operator to manage one’s entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver. It enables frictionless interaction with exchange and trade contracts.</p>
                  <p>Restricting approval to a certain set of token IDs, quantities or other rules MAY be done with an additional interface or an external contract. The rationale is to keep the ERC-1155 standard as generic as possible for all use-cases without imposing a specific approval scheme on implementations that may not need it. Standard token approval interfaces can be used, such as the suggested ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface which is compatible with ERC-1155.</p>
                  <h4>Usage</h4>
                  <p>This standard can be used to represent multiple token types for an entire domain. Both fungible and non-fungible tokens can be stored in the same smart-contract.</p>
                  <dt>Batch Transfers</dt>
                  <p>The safeBatchTransferFrom function allows for batch transfers of multiple token IDs and values. The design of ERC-1155 makes batch transfers possible without the need for a wrapper contract, as with existing token standards. This reduces gas costs when more than one token type is included in a batch transfer, as compared to single transfers with multiple transactions.</p>
                  <p>Another advantage of standardized batch transfers is the ability for a smart contract to respond to the batch transfer in a single operation using onERC1155BatchReceived.</p>
                  <p>It is RECOMMENDED that clients and wallets sort the token IDs and associated values (in ascending order) when posting a batch transfer, as some ERC-1155 implementations offer significant gas cost savings when IDs are sorted.

                  <p>The balanceOfBatch function allows clients to retrieve balances of multiple owners and token IDs with a single call.</p>
                  <dt>Enumerating from events</dt>
                  <p>In order to keep storage requirements light for contracts implementing ERC-1155, enumeration (discovering the IDs and values of tokens) must be done using event logs. It is RECOMMENDED that clients such as exchanges and blockchain explorers maintain a local database containing the token ID, Supply, and URI at the minimum. This can be built from each TransferSingle, TransferBatch, and URI event, starting from the block the smart contract was deployed until the latest block.</p>
               <p>ERC-1155 contracts must therefore carefully emit TransferSingle or TransferBatch events in any instance where tokens are created, minted, transferred or destroyed.</p>   
               <h4>Non-Fungible Tokens</h4>
                  <p>The following strategies are examples of how you MAY mix fungible and non-fungible tokens together in the same contract. The standard does NOT mandate how an implementation must do this:</p>
                 <dt>Split ID bits</dt>
                  <p>The top 128 bits of the uint256 _id parameter in any ERC-1155 function MAY represent the base token ID, while the bottom 128 bits MAY represent the index of the non-fungible to make it unique.</p>
                  <p>Non-fungible tokens can be interacted with using an index based accessor into the contract/token data set. Therefore to access a particular token set within a mixed data contract and a particular non-fungible within that set, _id could be passed as ' uint128: base token id '' uint128: index of non-fungible ' .</p>
                  <p>To identify a non-fungible set/category as a whole (or a fungible) you COULD just pass in the base id via the _id argument as ' uint128: base token id '' uint128: zero '. If your implementation uses this technique this naturally means the index of a non-fungible SHOULD be 1-based.</p>
                  <p>Inside the contract code the two pieces of data needed to access the individual non-fungible can be extracted with uint128(~0) and the same mask shifted by 128.</p>
                  <code>
                    uint256 baseTokenNFT = 12345 << 128;
              uint128 indexNFT = 50;
              
              uint256 baseTokenFT = 54321 << 128;
              
              balanceOf(baseTokenNFT, msg.sender); // Get balance of the base token for non-fungible set 12345 (this MAY be used to get balance of the user for all of this token set if the implementation wishes as a convenience).
              balanceOf(baseTokenNFT + indexNFT, msg.sender); // Get balance of the token at index 50 for non-fungible set 12345 (should be 1 if user owns the individual non-fungible token or 0 if they do not).
              balanceOf(baseTokenFT, msg.sender); // Get balance of the fungible base token 54321.
                  </code>
                  <p>Note that 128 is an arbitrary number, an implementation MAY choose how they would like this split to occur as suitable for their use case. An observer of the contract would simply see events showing balance transfers and mints happening and MAY track the balances using that information alone. For an observer to be able to determine type (non-fungible or fungible) from an ID alone they would have to know the split ID bits format on a implementation by implementation basis.</p>
                  <dt>Natural Non-Fungible tokens</dt>
               <p>Another simple way to represent non-fungibles is to allow a maximum value of 1 for each non-fungible token. This would naturally mirror the real world, where unique items have a quantity of 1 and fungible items have a quantity greater than 1.</p>

                 <li>If however myTransferFrom wishes to continue it MUST call supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0) on _to and if it returns the constant value true the transaction MUST be reverted, as it is now known to be a valid receiver and the previous acceptance step failed.

The balance of the contract MUST also be able to be determined by events alone meaning initial contract balances (for eg. in construction) MUST emit events to reflect those balances too.

                    <li>The “TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules” MUST be followed as appropriate for the burn(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the _to argument MUST be set to 0x0 (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a burn to contract observers.
              </li>
                    <li>When burning/destroying you do not have to actually transfer to 0x0 (that is impl specific), only the _to argument in the event MUST be set to 0x0 as above.

                    <li>The total value transferred from address 0x0 minus the total value transferred to 0x0 observed via the TransferSingle and TransferBatch events MAY be used by clients and exchanges to determine the “circulating supply” for a given token ID.
              </li>
              <li>As mentioned above mint/create and burn/destroy operations are specialized transfers and so will likely be accomplished with custom transfer functions rather than safeTransferFrom or safeBatchTransferFrom. If so the “Implementation specific transfer API rules” section would be appropriate. Even in a non-safe API and/or hybrid standards case the above event rules MUST still be adhered to when minting/creating or burning/destroying.

              <li>A contract MAY skip calling the ERC1155TokenReceiver hook function(s) if the mint operation is transferring the token(s) to itself. In all other cases the ERC1155TokenReceiver rules MUST be followed as appropriate for the implementation (i.e. safe, custom and/or hybrid).

                  <h4>Compatibility with other standards
              </h4>
                  <p>There have been requirements during the design discussions to have this standard be compatible with existing standards when sending to contract addresses, specifically ERC-721 at time of writing. To cater for this scenario, there is some leeway with the revert logic should a contract not implement the ERC1155TokenReceiver as per “Safe Transfer Rules” section above, specifically “Scenario#3 : The receiver does not implement the necessary ERC1155TokenReceiver interface function(s)”.</p>
                  <p>Hence in a hybrid ERC-1155 contract implementation an extra call MUST be made on the recipient contract and checked before any hook calls to onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived are made. Order of operation MUST therefore be:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The implementation MUST call the function supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0) on the recipient contract, providing at least 10,000 gas.
              </li>
                    <li>If the function call succeeds and the return value is the constant value true the implementation proceeds as a regular ERC-1155 implementation, with the call(s) to the onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived hooks and rules associated.
              </li>
                    <li>If the function call fails or the return value is NOT the constant value true the implementation can assume the recipient contract is not an ERC1155TokenReceiver and follow its other standard’s rules for transfers.
              </li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Note that a pure implementation of a single standard is recommended rather than a hybrid solution, but an example of a hybrid ERC-1155/ERC-721 contract is linked in the references section under implementations. An important consideration is that even if the tokens are sent with another standard’s rules the ERC-1155 transfer events MUST still be emitted. This is so the balances can still be determined via events alone as per ERC-1155 standard rules.</p>
                  
                  <h4>Metadata</h4>
                  <p>The URI value allows for ID substitution by clients. If the string {id} exists in any URI, clients MUST replace this with the actual token ID in hexadecimal form. This allows for a large number of tokens to use the same on-chain string by defining a URI once, for that large number of tokens.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be lowercase alphanumeric: [0-9a-f] with no 0x prefix.
              </li>
                    <li>The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be leading zero padded to 64 hex characters length if necessary.
              </li>
                    <li>Example of such a URI: https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json would be replaced with https://token-cdn-domain/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004cce0.json if the client is referring to token ID 314592/0x4CCE0.</li>

                  <p>If the optional ERC1155Metadata_URI extension is included:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The ERC-165 supportsInterface function MUST return the constant value true if 0x0e89341c is passed through the interfaceID argument.
              </li>
                    <li>Changes to the URI MUST emit the URI event if the change can be expressed with an event (i.e. it isn’t dynamic/programmatic). An implementation MAY emit the URI event during a mint operation but it is NOT mandatory. An observer MAY fetch the metadata uri at mint time from the uri function if it was not emitted.
              
              </li>
                    <li>The uri function SHOULD be used to retrieve values if no event was emitted.
              </li>
                    <li>The uri function MUST return the same value as the latest event for an _id if it was emitted.
              </li>
                    <li>The uri function MUST NOT be used to check for the existence of a token as it is possible for an implementation to return a valid string even if the token does not exist.

                  <p>An owner SHOULD be assumed to always be able to operate on their own tokens regardless of approval status, so should SHOULD NOT have to call setApprovalForAll to approve themselves as an operator before they can operate on them.</p>
